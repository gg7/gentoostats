$var title: Internal error

<p>Oops, it seems something is broke on the server. Please try again.</p>

<p><strong>Developer note:</strong> Because Google and Microsoft think its OK to violate web standards for their own benefit, you must ensure that your error pages are larger than 512 bytes if you wish them to be displayed instead of the "friendly" error pages the browsers show. Which is why this message is here. To make the page longer. Bah.</p>
